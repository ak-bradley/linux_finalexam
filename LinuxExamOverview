Linux – Final Examination Project: Automated Server Management

This project is an applied final examination assignment focused on Linux system administration, automation, and security, designed to simulate a real-world scenario for junior system administrators. 
The task was to build, secure, and manage a Linux-based server environment for a fictional company, emphasizing practical, hands-on skills rather than theory.

The project began with the installation and configuration of a Linux server in a virtualized environment. Core security measures were implemented, including firewall configuration, disabling root SSH login, 
enforcing key-based authentication, and installing required system packages. Secure remote access was configured and tested to reflect real operational conditions.

A structured user and group management model was implemented, including role-based access control with distinct groups, sudo privileges for administrators, and shared directories with correctly assigned 
permissions. This demonstrated an understanding of Linux permission models and least-privilege principles.

A central part of the assignment was automation using Bash scripting. Multiple scripts were developed to handle recurring administrative tasks, including automated backups with logging and retention policies,
user management through a menu-driven interface, and system reporting through log analysis. The system report script analyzed authentication logs, sudo usage, disk utilization, and SSH activity using standard
Linux tools such as grep, awk, sed, and pipelines, producing timestamped reports.

Additional focus was placed on operational reliability and security awareness, including log monitoring, disk usage thresholds, and optional alerting mechanisms. All scripts were documented and designed 
to be maintainable and fault-tolerant.

The project concluded with comprehensive documentation describing the system architecture, installation steps, script functionality, security configurations, and reflections on challenges and design
decisions. Sensitive credentials and access details have been intentionally excluded in accordance with security best practices.
